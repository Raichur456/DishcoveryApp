According to FARE, the Food Allergy Research and Education Institution, 33 million Americans suffer from food allergies. As of 2025, the current US population is about 342 million, which makes just under 10% of the population susceptible to having negative reactions to specific foods. FARE also mentioned that roughly 51% of adults with food allergies and 42% of children with food allergies have experienced a severe reaction. With the use of technology and food databases at our disposal, there is no reason for millions of Americans to be afraid of eating food on a daily basis. This is a need that needs to be addressed to prevent many other people from having allergic reactions. 


The app we decided to review that could conceptually fit these needs was Spokin by Spokin, Inc. (only available on iOS). The fact that this app is only available on iOS already means that it is not as widely available as it should be. Access to potentially life-saving information should have no kinds of restrictions, such as the kind of cellular device that you are running. Upon entering the app, there were many fantastic features, such as being able to give restaurants a review, follow users, and like certain posts. There was also a feature to only display posts close to your current area. However, some aspects of this app left a lot to be desired. A simple barcode scanner to scan whether or not some food item is good for you would be very helpful for people with allergens that do not wish to eat out that often, but still want that sense of community that Spokin gives.
