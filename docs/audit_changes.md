Our app was audited by Group 7 (Cinderella) by Ailsa Chen and Donara Galsyton. One of the tests they ran involved the color contrast between the text returned from the ingredient_result_page.dart file using the Image Color Picker, along with the WebAIM Contrast Checker to check for contrast problems. They determined that the text and background blended in too much. In response to this feedback, we decided to make this returned text black instead of red or green as it was previously, which made this part of the app much easier to read.  Additionally, another test that they ran involved changing the orientation of the application from portrait to landscape. This resulted in a pixel overflow, which visually broke the UI. In response to this, we leveraged widgets like LayoutBuilder and Expanded to ensure that our application was able to adjust to any screen orientation. These changes not only prevented any future crashes in the UI but also greatly improved the overall accessibility of the application.
